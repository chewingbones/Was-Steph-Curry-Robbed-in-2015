I believe and have always believed that Steph was robbed of Finals MVP in 2015. This project set out to prove that fact. The first step was scraping data and compiling it into dataframes."

That argument, however, is more for a conversation of who SHOULD win the MVP.

If we train a model on this data and teach it to try to choose the player who will win, it will be basing it off of who has won in the past.

    "\n",
    "1) The model wouldn't award a Finals MVP for most years that we tested. Only Bob Pettit in 1958 would meet the threshold in order to be classified in the correct cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Despite Bill Russell not crossing the model's threshold, he still has the highest probability of winning the award 8 years and is tied for the highest probability in two more years. That's a possibility of 10 awards for the man whom the award is named after.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It's a good sign that 1969 is one of the years for which there is confusion as it was the only year in the history of the league that had a Finals MVP on a losing team."

    "Steph Curry was probably not robbed of Finals MVP in 2015 based off of the historical selection of Finals MVPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, it is not the case that this model is trying to say who should win but who would win based off of who usually wins. That's what this model is measuring. The model has room for improvement that I'll discuss below, but several things strengthen the models output.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Steph not being a demonstrative winner in 2015 reflects the reality of the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The model predicted 8 Finals MVPs for Bill Russell (8 max probabilities that is). It also didn't predict that he would win outright in 1969 when the award was introduced and Jerry West, not Bill Russell, won.\n"

    "\n",
    "There are two obvious problems with the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The model does not account for players who recieved votes. A better version of this model would take into account who gets voted for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The model doesn't demand that one person win. Obviously we want to build a model that properly reflects reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A final disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "There were no advanced stats in this model. Things like usage rate and defensive and offensive rating could help the model determine Finals MVP. The exclusion of MPG improved the model's accuracy but changed probabilities for many players, notable Steph in 2015 who had a 56% chance of being Finals MVP with MPG in the model. I would have loved to have kept MPG in the model to justify my hypothesis but that wouldn't have been good science. What I will say is that advanced stats could help bolster the case for many players in the dataset and that MPG might capture impact (i.e. the more you play, the more impact you have) in a way that advanced metrics do on a much deeper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those metrics are less obvious to the naked eye and what this model is emulating is the naked eye (plus whatever stats the voters look at; probably not advanced stats). As such, it did a fairly good job. That being said, a cursory glance at any advanced metric will tell you that Steph should have won Finals MVP in 2015! This model has learned the ways of human error. Subjectively I believe that Steph should have won!"
