# Was-Steph-Curry-Robbed-in-2015
An Investigation into Steph Curry's (lack of a) 2015 Finals MVP. 
This investigation seeks to answer the question: WOULD Steph Curry have won Finals MVP based off of the way the FINALS MVP has generally been awarded? The question of SHOULD is a matter of debate that can get murky and highly subjective.
I scraped data from the web for all of the NBA Finals going back to 1969 (when Finals MVP was introduced) 
I looked at the biggest point differentials between Finals MVP and Leading Scorer on a team. 2015 was one of the biggest. Points is also a great indicator for who will win Finals MVP.
I built a model to predict who wins Finals MVP. The initial model used 5 features. Attempts with more features were made but the 5 basic features worked best as they are "traditional" stats which is what voters of the Finals MVP (and casual fans) typically pay attention to (remember, who WOULD win).

UPDATE
A clean copy of the project has been added alongside of the original copy. The cleaned up copy shows the best version of the model I built.
